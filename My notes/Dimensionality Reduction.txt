Dimensionality Reduction
   --Dimensionality reduction is a technique used in exploratory data analysis (EDA) to reduce the number of features (or dimensions) in a dataset
   --particularly useful when working with high-dimensional data

-->Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
-->t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE)




Principal Component Analysis (PCA):

  >>PCA is a linear dimensionality reduction technique that aims to find the directions (principal components) in which the data varies the most.
  >>used to visualize high-dimensional data in lower dimensions, identify patterns, and reduce noise.


t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE):

  >>t-SNE is a non-linear dimensionality reduction technique that is particularly effective for visualizing high-dimensional data in two or three dimensions.
