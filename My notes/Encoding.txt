Encoding Categorical Variables(by using this, Which can add more columns)

--One-Hot Encoding
--Binary Encoding
--Ordinal Encoding
--Target Encoding
--Handling High-Cardinality Categorical Variables
--count or frequency encoding(https://youtu.be/MPnNC6kkNC4?si=0VHsXMtKxsMxlwFE)

One-Hot Encoding:
    >>One-hot encoding is used to convert categorical data into a numerical format that can be used for machine learning algorithms
    >>It creates binary columns, one for each unique category, where a 1 indicates the presence of that category and 0 indicates its absence.
    >>it creates high dimensions, if that feature has many categorical values-->It leads to issue(curse of dimensionality)
    >>get_dummies() used

Binary Encoding:
     >>Binary encoding is another method for encoding categorical variables into a numerical format. It is similar to one-hot encoding but uses binary digits (0s and 1s) to represent each category.
    >>Binary encoding is useful for handling high-cardinality features(more unique values)


Encoding

                       --One-Hot Encoding(normal one hot encoding)
nominal encoding>>     --One-Hot Encoding with many category(if you have 50 categorical values in one feature, and 12 values are mostly repeated,and get    
                                                             that 12 values, use one hot  encoding on them )                                           
                       -->mean encoding(get mean values for the nominal value and replace it with he mean value)
                       -->median encoding



ordinal encoding>>   -->label encoding(use ranking method apple's to ordinal categories)
(ranking method      -->target guided with ordinal encoding(if a feature has may categorical values, an each has (1 or 0)values, get mean for that   
 it can use)                                                categorical values and get all the mean values for the categorical values(ordinal) and align  
                                                             label values as 1,2,3,..n [based on the rank get from the values of the mean])(based on the  
                                                              ranks, you have to assign labels)
