    > relationships among multiple variables 
    > techniques like correlation matrices, principal component analysis, and clustering 
    >pairplot(seaborn)


--Hypothesis Testing
    > testing hypotheses about the data, using statistical tests like t-tests, ANOVA, and chi-square tests


--outlier Detection
   >Identifying and analyzing outliers in the data
